Docker
======

Open Source
Written in Go

For any language, any database, targeting Linux (and more)
Use boot2docker on MacOSX and Windows
Build once, run everywhere
Deploy reliably and consistently
Take seconds to start

Your software runs repeatably everywhere because container include all dependencies

VM: runs full guest OS on top of host OS, large in size
Docker: runs with host OS, small in size


docker login
docker push leapon/dnrdw
